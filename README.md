# Typescript Data Structure
This repo contains the basics of data structures. If you're migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript, I recommend [TypeScript 4 Beginners](https://github.com/redmejia/learning-typescript) which covers the fundamentals of TypeScript.

# What You'll Learn

- Arrays: Ordered collections of elements, accessible by index.
- Linked Lists: Linear collections of elements, where each element points to the next.
- Stacks: Last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structures for managing elements.
- Queues: First-in, first-out (FIFO) data structures for handling elements.
